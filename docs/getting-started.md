# Getting Started

## Install

### Redux Saga v0.15

The current version of Redux Saga Test Plan **v3** only supports **v0.15**
of Redux Saga.

Install with yarn or npm.

```
yarn add redux-saga-test-plan --dev
```

```
npm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan
```

### Redux Saga v0.14

If you're still using Redux Saga v0.14, the
[upgrade](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/releases/tag/v0.15.0) to
v0.15 should be effortless.

If you can't upgrade from v0.14, though, then you can use the latest **v2** of
Redux Saga Test Plan.

**NOTE:** newer features will only be added to **v3** of Redux Saga Test Plan,
so you should upgrade Redux Saga if you're able.

Install with yarn or npm.

```
yarn add redux-saga-test-plan@^2.0 --dev
```

```
npm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan@^2.0
```
